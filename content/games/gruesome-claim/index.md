## Gruesome Claim

This game was my foray into photo-realism with Godot 4. The game itself relied heavily on third party, high quality assets. The focus on my work on it was to create interesting mechanics.

The premise of the game is that you play as an insurance investigator checking in on a client who seems to have suddenly stopped paying.
