## Game Overview

*Ascension Of The Lamb* is a "Retro PBR" game about exploring a mysterious cult bunker.

## Story of the Creation

I participated in the [Go Godot Jam 3](https://gogodotjam.com/the-jam/), which to save you a click is a game jam coordinated by the Godot community, specifically 'Redefine Gamedev', who is a fairly active member of the community. The jam was very exciting, with online social events planned for participants and hosted by various well known community members.

I participated in the "Classic" experience, which was the easier of the two. We had roughly 9 days to make the game and were allowed to work on a team. I did end up working alone. But I was still determined to finish this game. I was excited to get working on making horror games. And for this one, I wanted to focus on setting up a proper atmosphere. Which if the feedback I got was honest, I think I succeeded there.

The Theme for the jam was "Evolution" and I wanted to take that into an artistic interpretation of the cultists believing they would "evolve" or rather ascend into a higher form of life. The cult itself was inspired by some of the famous American cults from the 80s and 90s.

## Gameplay

The game is essentially a walking simulator. There is a simple physics simulation system that I used to make some simple puzzles and encourage exploration. There are two main ["lock and key"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockAndKeyPuzzle) puzzles which serve to stop the player and encourage them to explore the area more.

## Visual Style - Retro PBR

For this game, I wanted to create a Playstation-similar style. I personally don't have any nostalgia for the Playstation, but I've seen a lot of other small indie horror games using the Playstation style to evoke a nostalgic feeling in the players. I wanted to add my own twist to it so I tweaked the parameters a bit. I kept the texture size of 128x128 and the dithering. But I swapped the standard blocky [bayer-matrix dithering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter) for [blue noise dithering](https://momentsingraphics.de/BlueNoise.html). I used two noise textures scrolling in different directions across the screen to affect the dithering which gave every surface a almost pulsating effect. Additionally, while I was going for a Retro look, I opted to use [PBR textures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering), specifically albedo, metallic, normal, and roughness.

I got some praise for this visual effect and I've taken to calling it "Retro PBR" as a general way to describe Retro-similar visuals that utlize a PBR rendering pipeline.

I did struggle a lot with ["shadow acne"](https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/intermediate-tutorials/tutorial-16-shadow-mapping/). It was quite difficult because this version of Godot had some issues with the 3D rendering. It was generally considered unfit for making 3D games, but I tried anyway.

## Overall Reception

The game did fairly well considering how it was made. Feedback ranged but there were a few common notes:

- [X] Writing is very good
- [X] Atmosphere is well set up
- [ ] The game lacks action, which makes it less fun to play
- [ ] Some players suggested adding jumpscares to make more of a haunted house experience

## My comments on the game

I feel that this game was a success for where I was at my experience level for the time. I had some specific goals and I accomplished them. Because I went for an artistic interpretation of the jam theme, it did not do very well. Likewise, I encountered several issues with my workflow such as a lack of experience in Blender, which I used for creating the level geometry, as well as struggling with the 3D capabilities of Godot 3, which uses a fairly outdated [OpenGL ES 3](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/) based rendering engine.

I think like many of my projects, this game served as an opportunity for me to learn. The feedback I got for this game really helped me hone my craft and I am incredibly grateful to everyone involved in the jam for helping me grow.
