This is a backlog, meaning that I do want to do everything here, I just have this terrible condition called *mortality* that causes me to have to pick and choose what to do first. So I'll use this page to update my current goals for article subjects. And if you are feeling so inclined, you can reach out to me and let me know what is most interesting to you! And of course you can donate to really incentivize me (see the kofi donate button/link).

## Programmatic RayCasting in Godot 4

Casting a ray is easy when you use the node `RayCast3D`, but what if you want to perform 100s of raycasts? That's where the programmatic side of things can be more helpful.

## Virtual Camera Systems

Godot's cameras are excellent, but they are not as great for advanced cinematography compared to virtual camera systems, which allow unique constraints to be placed on the camera such as a "Dolly Track" or having a set movement speed.
