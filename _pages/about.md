# Forward

> I have been working hard for many years to hone my crafts. I enjoy telling stories and utilizing diverse mediums to tell those stories. I work with game development and in my final year of college got into traditional story writing through short story fiction. 
>
> I do a majority of my online work under the alias, "Queen Of Squiggles". I've found that using an alias offers me a modicum of anonymity, which helps to protect my friends and family from any potential bad actors that would wish me harm. If you are reading this as a prospective employer, I hope you can understand my choice to not include my name in my online work.

> It may also be interesting to note that for a majority of my projects (included those listed here), I accomplished them while also acting as a full time student, studying Computer Science.
