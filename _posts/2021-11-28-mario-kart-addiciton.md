Recently, I have been playing Mario Kart with some friends recently and I've developed an obsession.

## I don't even own a copy of Mario Kart!

I don't own a switch and I have limited access to the game, which is why I have set a personal goal for myself.


## I want to make a kart racer in Godot

Using my game engine of choice `Godot`, I want to make a kart racing game on par with Mario Kart. I have several objectives for this project.

As with every project, I want to use this as a learning opportunity. I want to get better as a game developer through this project while also making something fun to play.

Some of the problems I run into with Mario Kart is that it is hard to play with larger numbers of people. The controllers are expensive, the console is expensive, and multiple copies to use the paid online system is also expensive.

### The problems I identified with Mario Kart 8:
 * Difficult to couch-play with 5+ people
 * Fairly expensive to play online
    * Online play has no voice chat system so it's not the best
 * The equipment needed to play as well as the game itself are not cheap

### My solutions:
 * Make my game allow for an arbitrary number of players
    * If I have to set a limit because of tech limitations, I want to set it as high of a limit as possible. Like 12 people
 * Brand Name is too expensive -> my game will be free

 Extra considerations:

 ### Other Considerations

 #### *Streaming*
 
 I want streamers/youtubers/other content creators to have an easy time using my game to make their content. The game will already be free so barrier to access should be low, but I also want to ensure a few features to make the game better.
Overall, I want to avoid proprietary music and copyrighted music that could be an issue for streamers. But I want to go further and have some metadata for the different music tracks so I can have a setting for players to disable stream-unfriendly content.

#### *Community Content*

Despite having some [concerns](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGamePerversityPotential) about community content, I feel that it is the best way to allow for players to customize their experience. If players want to engage with the more NSFW content which I expect to occurr, that is their choice. I'm going to make this game focused on playing with friends, not for public servers, so talk over with your friends if you want to do that! Consent is key!

The absoultely wonderful thing about using Godot, I can allow players to make their own levels with animations, custom models, details, etc... and just export it so I can load it into my game. This is something I want to learn how to do, because I LOVE community content!!!

Making mods for minecraft is what got me started with programming and started my passion for games. It's been years since then and I'm still going on this love of creating entertainment.

#### *Online Multiplayer*

I ultimately would love to implement online multiplayer so people can play with people they cannot meet with in person. With omicron just being found recently I'm worried we may go back to lockdowns soon. So implementing online multiplayer may make (or break) my game. However, I've never done anything multiplayer so I'm planning on doing local multiplayer first, then I'll figure out online multiplayer. 

I think using Steam's matchmaking systems might be the best way to do it, but I would need the $100 application fee so I may need some crowdfunding to get that far


## The "Game Plan"

First, I will make a local multiplayer kart racer which may have some similarities to a popular video game called "Mario Kart"

Next, I will release the game for free and work on marketing and setting up the things I need for

Step 3: Crowdfunding. I need to make $100 in order to put the game on steam. More money would probably just go to easing my anxiety over tuition costs.

Finally, once the game is on steam I can start implementing the steamSDK functionality I want. I'll work on online multiplayer first, then maybe make achievements as well.
