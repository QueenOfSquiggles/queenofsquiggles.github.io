**Content Warning**: This story includes alcohol and threats of violence.


Mary sipped on the champagne. The music blaring out of the speakers behind her thumped in her skull. Someone was looking at her. Moving their mouth, making noise, but saying very little. She recalled how the drink used to burn, leaving her throat too weak to say much.

“Thanks for the party,” the person was saying.

Mary saw her brother John passed out in a chair across the floor. Their apartment had floor space for a large party and even a DJ. But that didn’t protect them from getting tired.

She felt a buzz coming from her clutch. She didn’t know the number, but several people had already called to ask for the address. She stepped into the bathroom, the stink of vomit and nearly pure alcohol stung her nostrils.

“Hello? Are you calling about the party? We’re just on Bourbank Avenue South, a few blocks north of the library with the musical toys.”

“Am I speaking to Ms. Mary Skolvinksy?”

“Yes?”

“I’m Bob calling from Charles and Co Electric Company. We are your provider for electricity and you have an outstanding bill of $500. Your last payment was on June the 23rd, about four months ago now. Your recent check, totaling $350, arrived here on September 20th. However this check has bounced. Do you have an alternate payment option?”

“I’m sorry what?”

“I apologize. Your most recent payment has bounced. Do you have a different form of payment?”

“No. No. I’m sorry. I do understand the situation. I’m just confused how the check could bounce?”
A roar came from the party. Chanting ensued. The door muffled it, but she could tell they were opening another keg or four.

“Ma’am. You have been receiving out written notices, correct?”

“I’m not sure. My brother, John, takes care of the mail.”

“Well I regret to inform you that this is your final warning. Payment is due, in full, by October 15th, that would be this upcoming Friday. Failure to pay in full by that date will result in termination of services. Simply put, we’ll cut off your electricity.”

“Uhm. OK. I. I think I need to talk with John.” She placed the phone on the sink counter. Numb and her mind racing, she slowly opened the bathroom door, only to once again be blasted by the pounding of the music’s bass.
She found John laying with a woman in tight jeans and a mohawk. They were on the old couch they bought for their old studio apartment. Her thin leather vest was falling off of her. He was still in his fake work-wear he always wore for parties. They were both fast asleep. Like children oblivious to the war raging around them. 

“John. John. John. Asshole. C’mon,” she grabbed at his arm, then simply grabbed his torso and pulled. The two of them rolled and fumbled out of the couch. The woman awoke, eyes darting back and forth like she was a caged animal seeking escape. She looked at John and made an obvious grimace before collecting herself and running into the crowd. John was still fast asleep.
Mary started kicking him in the ribs. He jolted at the first one. The second one he opened his eyes. The third one he started groaning. And the fourth he found the strength to roll away before the fifth could find its mark. The commotion of the hosts fighting had drawn attention, but no one thought to pause the music. So there they stood. John holding himself against the seat of the couch. Mary standing over him with a wild look in her eyes. The crowd of strangers looking on. Sipping their drinks, and whispering to each other. And through it all the music thundered through their skulls. Mary squared her shoulders, put her hands on her hips, and did her best impression of their mother she could.

“Do ya read the mail often?”

“Of course I do.

“Well then, do you wanna tell me what’s wrong then?”

“Nothing. Everything’s fine. We’re having a party? It’s going great!” he smiled, but his eyes betrayed him.

“You can’t really hide it from me.”

“Hide what?” his face lost its steel. He looked panicked.

“Our bills. Our money. And something about not having any. What the fuck did you do?”

“OK. OK OK OK,” he lifted himself onto the couch and sat. “I thought we could make the money last longer if we took a ‘strategical approach’ to paying our bills.”

Mary stepped her boot onto the couch seat. Placing it dangerously close to his crotch. The threat was clear. He cowered and guarded himself with his frail hands in a vain attempt to protect himself.

“I thought that the companies make enough money they wouldn’t notice a late bill or two. And the extra money meant we could afford to have some more parties. You like the parties right?”

“I did when I thought we’d still have our lights on!”

“It’s not gone yet, right? We can just pay the bills that are due. My idea can still work. And then I can still party.”

“Then get to it.” She placed her foot on his chest and leaned in, pressing what weight she had against him. He squirmed. “This party is over until you’ve paid off every last bill we owe. And you don’t have to worry about that girl. She already left. You don’t even deserve her.”

“Fuck. Jesus. Calm down Mary. I’ll go. I’ll go”

She leaned back and placed her feet on the ground. Still in a square stance to maintain her dominance in the situation. John ran away to his bedroom, Mary could almost hear the whimper of a sad dog out of him. Then she walked over to the speakers and yanked the cords. The music stopped abruptly. The crowd fell silent.

“Get the fuck out assholes. Party’s over”


> This story was originally written for a class assignment where we were challenged to come up with an incredibly dramatic premise, in the style of Margaret Atwood's ["Happy Endings"](https://genius.com/Margaret-atwood-happy-endings-annotated). Then we were to write out in detail a single scene adding as much detail, drama, and character development as we could. Because of this, this scene is what would be part of a larger story following John and Mary's 'rags to riches' story. I did my best to make this story stand on its own, but there are parts that do leave something more to be desired.
>
> Also no doubt this story is evidence that no one invites me to parties. I have no clue what the 'fun people' do at them.
