Scarlet had wandered her local Walmart for what felt like days. She couldn’t find what she was looking for. What was she looking for again? Sometimes her mind grew fuzzy but the pangs of hunger would bring her back to reality. Still struggling to remember, but at least cognizant, she would see a few other regulars shambling around the store. No doubt they were searching for their own items as well. To pass the time, she would imagine things. Sometimes she was a very rich lady, clutching a candle-stick as she explored the vastness of her mansion. Or she would imagine that Margaret and her were zoologists, working in a vast zoo. The other patrons would be the zoo animals they took care of. Other times she would imagine that Terry and her were about to be married. They would prepare a wedding registry, excitedly choosing which bake-ware they prefer, which dice were best, which books they liked.

One day, as she was preparing her registry, she thought she saw a strange looking person, dirty and shabby, creeping through the store. She walked over to where she had seen them, and looked around. She saw a short man, crouching low and creeping through the store. He looked panicked and very dirty. And despite all this, something awoke in her when she gazed upon him. She could see his fore-arms clutching the metal frames of the racks. The way his firm muscles moved like thick worms just under his skin. His face, despite the panicked expression, was quite easy to look at. He almost looked like a prince. Luckily not so much Hapsburg, but more Prince Harry. He was crouching, tense with lines of sweat clearing through the dirt on this body. He then swiftly and silently moved to the next aisle, always looking up and down each aisle. Scarlet had just been down those aisles yesterday. They had been empty for a while, they were growing dust and mold. He must not be a regular. No matter, she hoped he would stay. She longed to chat, to find out more about this mystery man. However, as she was swooning at the idea of having a romantic lunch date, he looked back her way. His face went completely white. Perhaps he was sneaking because he didn’t want to be seen? How very much like a prince. He moved even more slowly now.

Since they were locking eyes now, Scarlet tried to make a polite wave. She had no intention of making a scene, she wanted this prince all to herself! He looked puzzled and gave a small wave back. It was positively adorable how he slightly cupped his hand as he waved. Scarlet began to walk towards him, slowly as not to raise suspicion from the other patrons. But as she drew nearer he became more and more panicked. He was moving quicker and quicker. Her prince was trying to escape! She quickly forgot about making a scene and started running. Or at least walking as fast as she could; her wiggly legs couldn’t accommodate a full sprint anymore. He rounded a corner and so did she. As she turned to see where he had gone, she saw him drawing a knife.

Looking at him again, she thought maybe he didn’t look so much like a prince anymore. Perhaps he was actually a spy? Maybe he was supposed to gather intel on this shopping center, and would report back to HQ? How very exciting! She would wed him all the same. Perhaps they could become a powerful spy duo. Together they could fight for truth, justice, and most importantly love. Oh how wonderful such a thing could be —SHINK-- she felt a dull ache in her left side and a wetness spilling down her body. Most importantly, she could smell this mystery man near her. She opened her eyes to see him. Such a gorgeous face. He had pleasant green eyes, almost emerald and darker brown hair that was messy and cut short. He had some facial hair too. Not a full beard but a scruff that framed his jaw. And there was that intoxicating smell coming off of him.

She could almost feel his warmth, and for the first time in so long, she felt cold compared to his brilliant warmth. But his face was contorted into a grimace. He looked angry. Had she done something wrong? She looked down to see he was removing a knife from her side. Thick, black liquid spilled out of her, staining the blade, his hand, and her clothes. She looked back at him, sad that he would do such a thing to her, his spy partner and wife. She reached out for him, to let him know that she couldn’t hold such a thing against him, but he shied away.

Was he trying to break up with her? That bastard! He took everything from me! He can have the house but he’ll never have the dining room table. I bought that with my own money waiting tables at the Waffle House —SHINK-- this time the knife swung at her hands and the left one came clean off. Such a sharp knife. And such a strong man! How could she stay mad at him. She reached for him again, trying to give him a kiss on the head, so he knew she would always love him and that they could go about finishing their wedding registry. Terry groaned nearby. Oh no! How could she live with herself if Terry found out! Lusting for another man the night before their wedding! But no...had she ever truly loved Terry? He was rather dull. No. She found someone better. This mystery man, Jeremy? Josh? John? Yes, John would protect her. He would keep her warm and safe and loved. She just needed to get him. She felt her body light alive with power as she made this resolution. And with all of her strength, she lunged at him. She bit off a chunk of his arm, it was warm, and juicy. It was like the sweetest cut of meat she had ever tasted. And yet, she suddenly remembered why she was there. She was hungry! She needed food, flesh, blood! Her ravenous hunger took over as she lunged at John again and again. He became terrified and started to run away, no longer creeping like the sneaky spy or regal prince.

She followed his dirty pawprints, or were those boots? They trailed behind him, leading her to her man. But all the commotion had alerted some of the others. She desperately wanted to say, “Oh no, leave this one to me. He’s already mine!” But she knew no one would care. Many of the other patrons were much more desperate than her. She tried to give chase, as the horde of fellow patrons followed. But John was much faster. He left the Walmart at break-neck speed. And Scarlet had to accept that she might never see him again. She never would. All she could do was lament the joyous moment they could have had, as the night after their wedding, she feasted on his brains.

> This story was written for a school assignment. We were tasked to write out a proper story while also using a short list of key terms. Some of the key terms are integrated more eloquently than others. "candle-stick" was probably handled the best while "paw prints" feels rather dodgy.
