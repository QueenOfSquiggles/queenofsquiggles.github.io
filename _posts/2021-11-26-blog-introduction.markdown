A brief introduction into what this blog is and why I am making it.


## Why am I making a blog????

I primarily use Twitter for social media, but I want to start writing longer posts like for tutorials, explanations, and general blog posts. Twitter is a pretty bad for long posts.

## Why would anyone want to look at my blog????

I'm going to document my journey. I'll write some tutorials and talk about what I learn as I work on my passion for making games. Hopefully the posts that I write help someone else along the way!
