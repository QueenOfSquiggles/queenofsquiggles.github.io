{: .notice--warning}
**Content Warning**: This story includes potentially disturbing themes.

{: .text-justify}
The night was brisk. I stepped up and out of Jimmy’s low riding four-door sedan. The axles screamed at the affront as they bent towards the ground.

{: .text-left}
“Jimmy, your car is kind of shit. Ever told you that?”

{: .text-left}
“I like to think of it as the shit. Anyways, we made it didn’t we?”

{: .text-justify}
The large, smooth bricks of the school loomed over us, the moon was barely peaking past the rooftop. The windows were black with the stray object visible in the darkness. The wind picked up and Jimmy held his hat for a moment, and grinned,

{: .text-left}
“All right, let’s get it!”

{: .text-justify}
We walked in, his garish orange flannel swishing quietly as he walked. The stone floors echoing with each step, and amplifying each swish.

{: .text-left}
“Hey ho Henry oh, you got that camcorder right?”

{: .text-left}
“Nah. I left it back at your mom’s place last night.”

{: .text-left}
“Nice. Real clever. But really?”

{: .text-left}
“Of course.”

{: .text-justify}
The camcorder was thin. With smooth, silver plastic plating that hid the fragile mechanics behind it. As I took it out from my jacket pocket, it nearly slipped out of my hands.

{: .text-left}
“Careful there. We don’t want to miss our chance. He only comes out for finals week you know?”

{: .text-left}
“I didn’t actually. Tell me again which of your crackhead friends told you this story?”

{: .text-left}
“Well I will have you know that Max is a respectable and dignified person. And they would resent that remark...true as it may be.”

{: .text-left}
“Did they put you up to speaking like that too?”

{: .text-left}
“Comes with the occasion. He wears a suit and all that. Gotta make myself a bit more fancy.”

{: .text-justify}
I gazed down to Jimmy’s off-brand sweatpants that were so long they covered his heels from time to time.

{: .text-left}
“Yes. Fancy. That’s what I’m seeing.”

{: .text-justify}
We had been walking through the halls for what felt like hours when we finally made it to the staircase. It was in the west wing of the school, and contained several floors. Our target was the fourth floor English hall. 

{: .text-left}
“Jimmy. You don’t actually believe this urban legend right? Some jackass with a bell hanging around a school at night, eating kids with bad grades? It’s probably just some homeless dude that was hiding out and got caught.”

{: .text-left}
“Well I have it on good authority that if he is real, I can go viral with some footage of him.”

{: .text-justify}
The stairs were the same smooth stone. Small brown, gray, and white stones were scattered into the material. But it shone smooth as if layered with an acrylic. Entombed forever in the prison of the halls. 

{: .text-left}
“I think you mean we can go viral? I’m getting a cut for this asinine job.”

{: .text-left}
“Uh. Yeah. Sure. Whatever.”

{: .text-justify}
Jimmy waved his hand at me as if I shouldn’t worry. Which incidentally made me worry even more. At the second floor I noted that the doors to the stairwell were left slightly ajar. No doubt the janitor had forgotten to lock them up at the end of the day. Jimmy began to wheeze as he started on the next flight of stairs. The flannel was sticking to his skin like a body suit. I could already start to smell him.

{: .text-left}
“Fuck I’m outta shape”

{: .text-justify}
We took on the next flight. Jimmy wheezed and coughed along. 

{: .text-left}
“Maybe you want to take a puff of your inhaler, buddy?”

{: .text-justify}
Jimmy looked at me dumbfoundedly. Then he patted the right pocket of his sweatpants, just to the left of the dumb bulldog logo.

{: .text-left}
“Fuck”

{: .text-left}
“What?”

{: .text-left}
“I don’t have it”

{: .text-left}
“Fuck”

{: .text-left}
“Well it’s not like I’m gonna die without it. It’s just some stairs.”

{: .text-left}
“Dude. I can hear your lungs from across town. You’re gonna wake up the principal at this rate.”

{: .text-left}
“Fine. Fine. Let’s just take it a bit more slowly then.”

{: .text-justify}
And so we climbed, slowly now. Jimmy continued to wheeze and cough, luckily it was becoming less and less frequent. By the time they reached the third floor, Jimmy slumped down against the wall and looked at me. There was a little bit of panic in his soft green eyes.

{: .text-left}
“Just give me a minute. And don’t you dare tell my mom.”

{: .text-justify}
I took my backpack off and sat next to him. Glad for a short rest myself. I rummaged through my backpack for some water. I had a small silver canister, with a dark magenta straw top to make it easy to drink. I held it in front of Jimmy’s face.

{: .text-left}
“Here”

{: .text-left}
“What?”

{: .text-left}
“Drink. It’s no inhaler, but maybe it’ll help.”

{: .text-left}
“Fine.”

{: .text-justify}
Despite his protest he seemed grateful for the water. He drank deeply, and breathed deeply as well. And when he finally handed it back, it was mostly empty. I unzipped my backpack and stashed it away in the bag. As I was standing up, I swung my backpack on and heard everything shifted inside. The metal clanked, papers rusted, and a bell jingled. But I didn’t have a bell.

> This story was written for a school assignment as well as for a game I hope to make. This story itself probably captures the introduction and tutorial segment of the game. After this story I have planned much more for poor Henry.
