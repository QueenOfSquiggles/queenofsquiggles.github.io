# About me

I have been making games in my spare time for *MANY* years. I have a lot of fun and try to exclusively have fun making games. This means that I can and will drop a project if it stops being fun. I feel free to do this mainly because no one is currently paying me to make games. [I would love for that to change someday ;)](https://ko-fi.com/queenofsquiggles). 

# Forgetful

I sometimes forget that I have this blog. There isn't really any system for feedback from it so I have a hard time keeping up with it. If you like my blog posts please let me know so I can keep sharing useful stuff here!
