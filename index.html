                            I have been programming for over a decade. I started way back with learning how to make mods for Minecraft in 2011. I was hooked instantly. I sought out different learning resources for learning even more. I starting making games in Java, since Minecraft mods were made in Java at the time. Then eventually I started using the Unity game engine and learned C# as well as the beginnings of tooling through EditorScript functionality. Finally, in 2020, I came to Godot where I currently spend most of my hobby time. The power of extensibility is something that I really appreciate of the Godot engine. Also the design makes developing games simple and enjoyable. Over the years I have done different challenges to stretch what I was currently capable of. 
                            My favourite challenge is Ludum Dare, a large game jam that is hosted periodically. I have been participating off and on over the years as free-time allows.

Is working to demonstrate how I am ALWAYS working on something useful? Does it make me a good worker? Employable and docile? Am I even a person at that point? Or just a statistic. 3 green blocks a month, hardly anything. 25 green blocks is barely enough. But I need that money. I wouldn't be doing hardly any of this if I didn't need the money. I'd just do what I felt passionate about and enjoy my time. I'd make fun little games without worrying about marketability. I'd write stories to read to my children at bedtime. I'd make so many shitposts. And not even just random posting but shitpost games and stories as well. I want to entertain people, I want to make people smile. I've spent too long without smiling I cannot imagine allowing someone to live out that fate. If I can't make myself better I need to make everyone else better. Make them happy. Help them forget their worries and be comforted. Is it selfish to want my stories, my games, my creations to provide that to people?

                <!-- Excellent project, incredibly hopeful. But I am ashamed that I might not be able to finish it. I did start it, and I did a lot of work on it. And people even gave me money for it, which makes me all the more guilty to potentially have to stop development. I feel obligated to finish it. But maybe that's just not for me? I do hope someone can fill the void for people who prefer visual scripting, but I wonder whether that preference would give reason for them to choose a different game engine entirely. Unreal is specifically really good for that kind of user. And arguably has some great documentation. Or perhaps I'm just rationalizing.
